## üîç Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Preparation (Python)**

* Loaded the dataset using Pandas
* Renamed columns to snake_case
* Handled missing values in `review_rating` using median imputation per category
* Created new columns such as `age_group` and `purchase_frequency_days`
* Exported cleaned data to MySQL database

### 2. **SQL Analysis (MySQL)**

Key business questions answered:

* Revenue comparison by gender
* Top-rated and top-selling products
* Impact of discounts on spending behavior
* Subscription vs non-subscription spending trends
* Revenue contribution by age groups
* Customer segmentation based on purchase history

### 3. **Dashboard Development (Power BI)**

The dashboard includes:

* Total revenue and customer KPIs
